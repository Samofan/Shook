<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There should be an app called Shook. You could make agreements with it - like bets with friends etc. Then you could say &quot;but we Shook on it&quot;</p>&mdash; Matt Jylkka (@mtmograph)</blockquote>

This is the idea of Shook. This repository is work in progress and some information are provided in the future.
